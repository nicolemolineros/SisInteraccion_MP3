# OpenMusic Melody for a Videogame

## Team Members:
- Nicole Molineros S.

## Project Description

This project involves the creation of a **suspense type melody** for a video game using **OpenMusic (OM)**. The melody was generated using algorithmic composition principles and OpenMusic's capabilities, such as lisp lists, loops, chords and other OM functionalities to control the musical structures.

The music has been carefully crafted to match the suspenseful theme of the video game and adheres to the specific requirements outlined below.

## Requirements

1. **Use of OpenMusic**: The melody was generated entirely within OpenMusic, using OM's programming capabilities.
2. **No Pre-Stored Material**: No pre-recorded audio files (wav, MIDI, mp3, etc.) were used. All sounds were algorithmically generated.
3. **Minimum Duration**: The musical piece is **2 minutes** long, ensuring a suitable length for the gameplay.
4. **Non-Repetitive Content**: At least 1 minute of the melody consists of non-repetitive, fresh musical content.
5. **Gameplay Video**: A video of the game with the composed musical piece has been uploaded to YouTube.

## Justification
The approach was chosen to create a **dynamic and evolving sound** that would keep the listener engaged throughout the gameplay. Randomized note selection adds unpredictability, an essential element in suspenseful scenes, while structured loops control the progression, ensuring the piece stays cohesive without repeating too soon.

By avoiding pre-recorded sounds, the project maintains full control over the melody's structure and timing, ensuring that the music aligns perfectly with the gameplay's emotional needs. Additionally, generating the music algorithmically allowed for a flexible and adaptive soundtrack that can be adjusted or extended if necessary.
